# Audio_signal_seperation_with_UX_Net

This is a time-domain audio separation model based on a modified U-Net(encoder-decoder) architecture. I researched about this in my internship. In the seperation module of this model, we use a sequence of CNN,RNN and feed forward layer on the input audio to get the most refined result.
